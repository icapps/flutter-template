## Update the translations

A custom dart program is used for updating the translations

https://pub.dev/packages/icapps_translations

Update your config in the pubspec.yaml
```
icapps_translations:
  api_key: 'enter-your-api-key'
  default_language: 'nl'
  languages: ['en', 'nl']
```

Add your locale folder to your flutter config
```
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/locale/
```

Command to run to update the translations
```
flutter packages pub run icapps_translations
```

## Json Serializable & Kiwi

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
```
